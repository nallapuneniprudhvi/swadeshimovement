    <h1>Gopal Krishna Gokhale</h1>
   <hr> <img src="gopal.jpg" alt="Gopal Krishna Gokhale" id="dada" ><br>
    <p><strong>Gopal Krishna Gokhale</strong> (9 may 1866 - 19 Febraury 1915) was and <strong>Indian liberal political leader</strong> and a <strong>Social reformer</strong> during Indian Independence Movement.</p>
    <p> Gokhale was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress and the founder of the Servants of India Society.</p>
    <p> Through the Society as well as the Congress and other legislative bodies he served in, Gokhale campaigned for Indian self-rule and for social reforms.</p>
    <p> He was the leader of the moderate faction of the Congress party that advocated reforms by working with existing government institutions.</p><br>
    <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
    <p>Gopal Krishna Gokhale was born on 9 May 1866 in Kotluk village of Guhagar taluka in Ratnagiri district, in present-day Maharashtra (then part of the Bombay Presidency) in a Chitpavan Brahmin family.</p>
    <p>Despite being relatively poor, his family members ensured that Gokhale received an English education, which would place Gokhale in a position to obtain employment as a clerk or minor official in the British Raj. </p>
    <p>He studied in Rajaram College in Kolhapur. Being one of the first generations of Indians to receive a university education, Gokhale graduated from Elphinstone College in 1884.</p>
    <p>Gokhale's education tremendously influenced the course of his future career â€“ in addition to learning English, he was exposed to Western political thought and became a great admirer of theorists such as John Stuart Mill and Edmund Burke.</p>

    <h2>Social Reforms</h2><hr>
    <p>Gokhale, though now widely viewed as a leader of the Indian nationalist movement, was not primarily concerned with independence but rather with social reforms.</p>
    <p>he believed such reforms would be best achieved by working within existing British government institutions, a position which earned him the enmity of more aggressive nationalists such as Tilak.</p>
    <p>Undeterred by such opposition, Gokhale would work directly with the British throughout his political career to further his reform goals.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>In 1899, Gokhale was elected to the Bombay Legislative Council.</p>
    <p>He was elected to the Imperial Council of the Governor-General of India on 20 December 1901.</p>
    <p>Again on 22 May 1903 as non-officiating member representing Bombay Province.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>The empirical knowledge coupled with the experience of the representative institutions made Gokhale an outstanding political leader, moderate in ideology and advocacy, a model for the people's representatives.</p>
    <p>His contribution was monumental in shaping the Indian freedom struggle into a quest for building an open society and egalitarian nation.</p>
    <p>Gokhale's achievement must be studied in the context of predominant ideologies and social, economic and political situation at that time, particularly in reference to the famines, revenue policies, wars, partition of Bengal, Muslim League and the split in the Congress at Surat.</p>
