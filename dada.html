    <p> He travelled to London in 1855 to become a partner in Cama & Co, opening a Liverpool location for the first Indian company to be established in Britain.</p>
    <p> Within three years, he had resigned on ethical grounds.</p>
    <p> In 1859, he established his own cotton trading company, Dadabhai Naoroji & Co. Later, he became Professor of Gujarati in University College London.</p>
