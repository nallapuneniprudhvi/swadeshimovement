    <h1>Bala Gangadhar Thilak</h1>
   <hr> <img src="bal.jpg" alt="Bala Gangadhar Thilak" id="dada" ><br>
    <p><strong>Bala Gangadhar Thilak</strong>(or Lokmanya Thilak) (23 July 1856 - 1 August 1920) was an <strong>Indian nationalist, teacher</strong> and an <strong>Independence Activist</strong>.</p>
    <p> He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate.</p>
    <p> Tilak was the first leader of the Indian Independence Movement. The British colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest."</p>
    <p> He was also conferred with the title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people (as their leader)".</p>
    <p><strong>Mahathma Gandhi</strong> called him <strong>"The Maker of Modern India"</strong>.</p>
    <p>Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ("self-rule") and a strong radical in Indian consciousness.</p>
    <p>He is known for his quote in Marathi: <strong>"Swarajya is my birthright and I shall have it!"</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
    <p>Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Indian Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency).</p>
    <p>His ancestral village was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen. </p>
    <p>In 1871 Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father's death. After marriage, her name was changed to Satyabhamabai. </p>
    <p>He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan College of Pune in 1877.</p>
    <p>He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the LL.B course instead, and in 1879 he obtained his LL.B degree from Government Law College .</p>
    <p>After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with the colleagues in the new school, he withdrew and became a journalist. Tilak actively participated in public affairs.</p>

    <h2>Political Career</h2><hr>
    <h3>Indian National Congress</h3>
    <p>Tilak joined the Indian National Congress in 1890.</p>
    <p>He opposed its moderate attitude, especially towards the fight for self-government. He was one of the most-eminent radicals at the time.</p>
    <p>In fact, it was the Swadeshi movement of 1905–1907 that resulted in the split within the Indian National Congress into the Moderates and the Extremists.</p>
    <p>Tilak was charged with incitement to murder and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. When he emerged from prison in present-day Mumbai, he was revered as a martyr and a national hero.</p>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Social Contributions</h3><hr>
    <p>Tilak started two weeklies, Kesari ("The Lion") in Marathi and Mahratta in English (sometimes referred as 'Maratha' in Academic Study Books) in 1880–81 with Gopal Ganesh Agarkar as the first editor.</p>
    <p>By this he was recognized as 'awakener of India', as Kesari later became a daily and continues publication to this day.</p>
    <p>In 1894, Tilak transformed the household worshipping of Ganesha into a grand public event (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav).</p>
    <p>The celebrations consisted of several days of processions, music, and food.</p>
    <p>They were organized by the means of subscriptions by neighbourhood, caste, or occupation. Students often would celebrate Hindu and national glory and address political issues; including patronage of Swadeshi goods.</p>
    <p>In 1895, Tilak founded the Shri Shivaji Fund Committee for the celebration of "Shiv Jayanti", the birth anniversary of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. </p>
    <p>The project also had the objective of funding the reconstruction of the tomb (Samadhi) of Shivaji at Raigad Fort.</p>
    <p>For this second objective, Tilak established the Shri Shivaji Raigad Smarak Mandal along with Senapati Khanderao Dabhade II of Talegaon Dabhade, who became the founder President of the Mandal.</p>
