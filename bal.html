    <h1>Bala Gangadhar Thilak</h1>
   <hr> <img src="bal.jpg" alt="Bala Gangadhar Thilak" id="dada" ><br>
    <p><strong>Bala Gangadhar Thilak</strong>(or Lokmanya Thilak) (23 July 1856 - 1 August 1920) was an <strong>Indian nationalist, teacher</strong> and an <strong>Independence Activist</strong>.</p>
    <p> He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate.</p>
    <p> Tilak was the first leader of the Indian Independence Movement. The British colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest."</p>
    <p> He was also conferred with the title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people (as their leader)".</p>
    <p><strong>Mahathma Gandhi</strong> called him <strong>"The Maker of Modern India"</strong>.</p>
    <p>Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ("self-rule") and a strong radical in Indian consciousness.</p>
    <p>He is known for his quote in Marathi: <strong>"Swarajya is my birthright and I shall have it!"</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
    <p>Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Indian Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency).</p>
    <p>His ancestral village was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen. </p>
    <p>In 1871 Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father's death. After marriage, her name was changed to Satyabhamabai. </p>
    <p>He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan College of Pune in 1877.</p>
    <p>He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the LL.B course instead, and in 1879 he obtained his LL.B degree from Government Law College .</p>
    <p>After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with the colleagues in the new school, he withdrew and became a journalist. Tilak actively participated in public affairs.</p>

    <h2>Political Career</h2><hr>
    <h3>Indian National Congress</h3>
    <p>Tilak joined the Indian National Congress in 1890.</p>
    <p>He opposed its moderate attitude, especially towards the fight for self-government. He was one of the most-eminent radicals at the time.</p>
    <p>In fact, it was the Swadeshi movement of 1905–1907 that resulted in the split within the Indian National Congress into the Moderates and the Extremists.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>In 1899, Gokhale was elected to the Bombay Legislative Council.</p>
    <p>He was elected to the Imperial Council of the Governor-General of India on 20 December 1901.</p>
    <p>Again on 22 May 1903 as non-officiating member representing Bombay Province.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>The empirical knowledge coupled with the experience of the representative institutions made Gokhale an outstanding political leader, moderate in ideology and advocacy, a model for the people's representatives.</p>
    <p>His contribution was monumental in shaping the Indian freedom struggle into a quest for building an open society and egalitarian nation.</p>
    <p>Gokhale's achievement must be studied in the context of predominant ideologies and social, economic and political situation at that time, particularly in reference to the famines, revenue policies, wars, partition of Bengal, Muslim League and the split in the Congress at Surat.</p>

During late 1896, a bubonic plague spread from Bombay to Pune, and by January 1897, it reached epidemic proportions. British troops were brought in to deal with the emergency and harsh measures were employed including forced entry into private houses, the examination of occupants, evacuation to hospitals and segregation camps, removing and destroying personal possessions, and preventing patients from entering or leaving the city. By the end of May, the epidemic was under control. They were widely regarded as acts of tyranny and oppression. Tilak took up this issue by publishing inflammatory articles in his paper Kesari (Kesari was written in Marathi, and "Maratha" was written in English), quoting the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, to say that no blame could be attached to anyone who killed an oppressor without any thought of reward. Following this, on 22 June 1897, Commissioner Rand and another British officer, Lt. Ayerst were shot and killed by the Chapekar brothers and their other associates. According to Barbara and Thomas R. Metcalf, Tilak "almost surely concealed the identities of the perpetrators".[14] Tilak was charged with incitement to murder and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. When he emerged from prison in present-day Mumbai, he was revered as a martyr and a national hero.[15] He adopted a new slogan coined by his associate Kaka Baptista: "Swaraj (self-rule) is my birthright and I shall have it."[16]
