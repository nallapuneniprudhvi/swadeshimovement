    <p><b>Make in India</b> is an initiative by the Government of India to encourage companies to manufacture in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement, and aimed <b>"To transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub."</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>"Make in India"</b> had three stated objectives:</p>
        <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 190px; padding-right: 30px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>To increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum;</li><br>
        <li>To create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022;</li><br>
        <li>To ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (later revised to 2025).</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>These objectives were identical to the United Progressive Alliance's 2011 National Manufacturing Policy. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called Make in India a “carbon copy” of the UPA policy.     
        After the launch, India gave investment commitments worth ₹16.40 lakh crore (US$230 billion) and investment inquiries worth of ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$21 billion) between September 2014 to February 2016. As a result, India emerged as the top destination globally in 2015 for foreign direct investment (FDI), surpassing the United States and China, with US$60.1 billion FDI. As per the current policy, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in all 100 sectors, except for Space industry (74%), defence industry (49%) and Media of India (26%).Japan and India had also announced a US$12 billion 'Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility" fund to push investment.        In line with the Make in India, individual states too launched their own local initiatives, such as 'Make in Odisha,' 'Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet,' 'Vibrant Gujarat,' 'Happening Haryana' and 'Magnetic Maharashtra.' India received US$60 billion FDI in FY 2016–17.        
        The World Bank's 2019 Ease of Doing Business report acknowledges India's jump of 23 positions against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 63rd rank among 190 countries. By the end of 2017, India had risen 42 places on Ease of doing business index, 32 places World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and 19 notches in the Logistics Performance Index, thanks to recent governmental initiatives, which include converges, synergies and enables other important Government of India schemes, such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Dedicated Freight Corridors, Industrial corridors, UDAN-RCS, Bharat Broadband Network, Digital India.</p>

        <p>
            The automotive sector has played a key role in the success of the government’s Make in India initiative.<ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 30px;text-align: justify;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><li > Many global carmakers – such as Renault, Suzuki, Honda, Volkswagen - have set up their manufacturing base in the country.
            Automotive companies are embracing the opportunity to leverage India as a hub for low-cost, high-quality products.</li><br><li>
            Over 500 million people are expected to be living in Indian cities by 2030. Clubbed with growing income levels, it is expected that India’s consumer class will expand, leading to higher spending on more and better vehicles across segments – providing automotive companies with a ready-made market.</li><br><li>           
            The Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2026 aims to position the Automotive Industry as the engine of the Make in India programme. The AMP 2026 presents the roadmap for the various segments within the automotive industry. It is collectively decided by the Government of India and the Indian Automotive Industry</li><br>
            <li>Some of the key highlights of the AMP 2026 include:<ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 30px;text-align: justify;padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><li>
