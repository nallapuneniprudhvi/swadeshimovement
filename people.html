    <h2>Swadeshi After Independence</h2><hr><br>
    <p>The "Swadeshi Revolution" of Post-Independence evolved differently from its equivalent in Pre-Independence.</p>
    <p>The Post-Independence Swadeshi movement arose as a reaction to more authoritarian capitalist policies, while the Pre-Independence movement was primarily a response to colonial policies in the post-Second World War India wanted to keep up with the advanced markets of the west for a country emerging from two decades of colonial injustice.</p>
    <p>Though rapid industrialization was aimed at enabling a self-sufficient India under the framework of the Five-Year Plans, the need to align it with a largely agrarian economy was urgent.</p>
    <p>This need to preserve the old fabric of an agrarian country, while simultaneously modernizing, necessitated a resurgence of a slightly recast "Swadeshi Movement". Forerunners of this resurgent movement were noted journalists, writers, and critics, including S. R. Ramaswamy.</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Later, the movement was joined by an Indian social activist Rajiv Dixit, a famous yoga instructor Swami Ramdev, and a social worker, Pawan Pandit.</p>
    <h2>National Handloom Day</h2><hr><br>
    <p>On 7 August 2015, Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, instituted and celebrated the first annual <b>"National Handloom Day of India"</b> to promote indigenous hand loom and khadi products.</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This date was chosen as on this date in 1905 the proclamation was made to commence the Swadeshi movement to avoid foreign goods and use only Indian-made products in order to rapidly improve the development of India.</p>
