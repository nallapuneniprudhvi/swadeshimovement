    <h1>Mahathma Gandhi</h1>
   <hr> <img src="gandhi.jpg" alt="Mahathma Gandhi" id="dada" ><br>
    <p><strong>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</strong>(or Mahathma Gandhi) (2 october 1869 - 30 january 1948) was an <strong>Indian Lawyer,anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist</strong> who employed non-violent resistance to lead the sucessful campaign for India's independence from British rule.</p>
    <p> Inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
    <p> The honorific <strong>Mahathma</strong>, first applied to him in 1914 in south Africa, i now used throughout the world</p>
    <p> His contributions to the formation of Modern India also gave him the title – <strong>"Father of the Nation"</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into an Gujarati Modh Bania family of the Vaishya varna in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire.</p>
    <p>His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. </p>
    <p>Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. </p>
    <p>During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless.</p>
    <p>In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.</p>
    <p>Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).</p>
    <p>In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security.</p>
    <p>In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.</p>
    <p>In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.</p>
    <p>In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.</p>
    <p>His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married.</p>
    <p>Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives."</p>
    <p>In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died. Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days.</p> 
    <p>The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900</p>

    <h2>Principles, Practices and beliefs</h2><hr>
    <h3>Influence</h3>
    <p>Gandhi grew up in a Hindu and Jain religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat, which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau.</p>
    <p>At age 57 he declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism.</p>
    <p>In fact, it was the Swadeshi movement of 1905–1907 that resulted in the split within the Indian National Congress into the Moderates and the Extremists.</p>
    <p>Tilak was charged with incitement to murder and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. When he emerged from prison in present-day Mumbai, he was revered as a martyr and a national hero.</p>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Society and other applications of is idea</h3><hr>
    <p>Gandhi was brought up as a vegetarian by his devout Hindu mother.</p>
    <p>The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in Hindu Vaishnavism and Jain traditions in India, such as in his native Gujarat, where meat is considered as a form of food obtained by violence to animals.</p>
    <p>Gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in Hindu and Jain texts.</p>
    <p>Gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should seek to understand and reduce the violence in what one consumes because "there is essential unity of all life"</p>
    <p>Beyond his religious beliefs, Gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet.</p>
    <p>He attempted to find the most non-violent vegetarian meal that the poorest human could afford, taking meticulous notes on vegetables and fruits, and his observations with his own body and his ashram in Gujarat. </p>
